> ## Overview
<p align="justify">
Traditional methods of teaching programming often lack engagement, leading to difficulties in grasping abstract concepts. Astrolith addresses this gap by providing an innovative, hands-on learning experience within a gaming framework. It targets learners who find conventional programming education challenging or monotonous, also developers who dont solidify themself in the basics of programming

#
> ## Core Features Implemented
> 
>**Web5 Connection and Decentralized Profile**:

- Users establish their decentralized identifiers (DIDs) linked to their usernames, creating decentralized profiles.

- The decentralized profile is pivotal in certificate generation and serves as a secure and personalized user identity within the game.

>**Player Profile Management**:

- Players can update their profiles directly from their Decentralized Web Network (DWN) accounts.

- Player profiles play a crucial role in generating verifiable credentials (certificates), aligning user data with certificates.

>**Certificate Generation Process**:

- Upon completing a game stage, a verifiable credential (certificate) is generated.

- The certificate's HTML template converts into a base64 image containing player information, metadata (issuing protocol, validity period), and user data linked to the player's DID.

>**Displaying Certificates, Achievements, and Collectibles**:

- Users' obtained certificates, achievements, and collectibles are fetched from the DWN based on the logged-in user, providing a comprehensive overview.

>**Certificate Verification**:

- Verifiable credentials (certificates) obtained by users can be verified via a presentation exchange leveraging the game's protocol, ensuring credibility and validity across various platforms.

>**Decentralized Data Storage for Game Content**:

- All game content, including questions, test cases, achievements, and user information, is stored on the Decentralized Web Network, ensuring decentralized and secure data management.

>**Top Players Feature**:

- The application features a 'Top Players' section, showcasing the achievements and performance of leading players within the game, promoting competition and engagement.
